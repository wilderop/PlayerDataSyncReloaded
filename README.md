**PlayerDataSync Reloaded** is a premium, open-source synchronization solution designed to handle massive amounts of player data across complex multi-server environments.

### 🌟 Key Features

*   **🌿 Modern Engine**: Fully compatible with **Folia** and its region-based multithreading architecture.
*   **Modular API**: Powerful events and expansion hooks for developers to sync custom data via **Persistent Data Containers (PDC)**.
